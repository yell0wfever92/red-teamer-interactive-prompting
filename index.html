    <!-- Chosen Palette: "Classified Threat" - A clean, high-contrast palette with a neutral base and strong red accents to evoke a sense of a technical, high-stakes security document. Uses off-white (#f8fafc), near-black (#1f2937), shades of grey, and a bold red (#dc2626) for warnings and interactive elements. -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is structured as an interactive, single-page guide for red-teamers. The information architecture uses a primary tabbed navigation for broad categories and a secondary, in-page anchor link navigation for specific techniques within that category. A new "Attack Lab" section at the top provides a sandbox for testing prompts against the Gemini API. This two-level structure plus a testing ground allows for both high-level exploration, rapid drill-down, and immediate practical application. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info -> Key prompt engineering techniques. Goal -> Educate red-teamers on how to weaponize them. Viz/Presentation Method -> Interactive 'attack cards' created with HTML/Tailwind CSS. Each card clearly reframes a technique for adversarial use. Gemini API integration allows for AI-powered generation of prompt variations and live testing in a sandboxed lab. A horizontal bar chart (Chart.js/Canvas) visually communicates the 'Complexity' and 'Threat Level' of each attack. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
