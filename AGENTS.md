# Project Upgrades & Future Plans

This document outlines potential enhancements and future directions for the Red Teamer Interactive Prompting Site.

## Immediate Upgrades

-   **Enhanced UI for Logs:** Implement sorting, filtering (by IP, date range), and pagination on the `logs.html` page to better manage and analyze a large number of prompts.
-   **User Authentication:** Add a simple user login system to associate prompts with specific users instead of just IP addresses. This would allow for more personalized analysis.
-   **Display Gemini's Response:** Modify the logging to also store the response from the Gemini API alongside the prompt. Display this in the logs view.

## Logical Future Enhancements

-   **Prompt Comparison View:** Create a UI that allows for a side-by-side comparison of a prompt and its "variation" response, making it easier to evaluate the effectiveness of the rephrasing.
-   **Tagging and Categorization:** Allow users or admins to tag prompts with categories (e.g., "jailbreak attempt," "data extraction," "roleplay"). This would help in organizing and analyzing different types of adversarial prompts.
-   **Automated Analysis:** Integrate a script that runs periodic analysis on the stored prompts to identify trends, common attack vectors, or interesting patterns in user submissions.
-   **Export Functionality:** Add a feature to export logs to CSV or JSON format for external analysis in other tools.

## "Blue Sky" Ideas

-   **Leaderboard/Gamification:** Introduce a system where users can "score" prompts based on their effectiveness, creating a gamified environment for red teaming.
-   **Integration with other LLMs:** Add the ability to send the same prompt to multiple large language models (e.g., GPT-4, Claude) and compare their responses directly.
-   **Collaborative Prompting:** Allow multiple users to work on and refine a prompt together in real-time.
